# UCI Schedule Builder App

This is a very very very old application I made years ago. The purpose of this app was to allow a user to enter a list of courses they needed, and this would find all possible schedule combinations that included the required courses. A user could specify time constraints if they wanted. 

After finding all schedule combinations, the user could then select the one they wanted based on gaps between classes, class locations, professors, etc.

## Disclaimer
I made this many many years ago. It is probably pretty buggy and terrible. I have not tested to confirm it still works. If UCI changes WebSOC format, then this will break.
